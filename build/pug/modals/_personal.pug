                                    |                 I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot,
                                    |                 which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy,

                                    |                 that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke
                                    |                 at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

                                    | The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth.
                                    | For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ
                                    | in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a
                                    | new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To
                                    | achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common
                                    | words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple
                                    | and regular than that of the individual languages.

                                    | Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                                    | when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

                                    | remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                                    | sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                                    | like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
